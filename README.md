# Dijkstra-s-algorithm-
Dijkstra's algorithm is a shortest-path algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph. It is a greedy algorithm that iteratively explores neighboring nodes to find the shortest path. Its implementation is efficient and uses a priority queue to select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
